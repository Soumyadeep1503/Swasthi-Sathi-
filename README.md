An end-to-end research project to assess the effectiveness and socio-economic impact of the West Bengal government's flagship health insurance program.
This study involved survey design, data collection, statistical analysis, and policy recommendation. 
Quantitative Analysis: Applied statistical models, including Logistic Regression and the Kruskal-Wallis test, to identify the key determinants of scheme enrollment and satisfaction across various demographic groups. Disparity Identification: Analyzed survey data from 129 respondents to uncover significant disparities in scheme uptake across religious, caste, and income lines, revealing challenges in equitable outreach. 
Impact Assessment: Evaluated the scheme's success by measuring beneficiary satisfaction and utilization rates, finding that while over 50% of users were satisfied, non-use was significantly influenced by the limited empanelment of preferred doctors and hospitals. 
Policy Recommendation: Identified a critical gap between beneficiary awareness and underutilization of scheme benefits.
I've formulated data-driven recommendations for targeted Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) strategies to enhance public knowledge and improve healthcare access.
